{"name":"Rocknclimb","tagline":"Web application for bouldering ","body":"### Welcome to Rocknclimb Project.\r\nThis project made in order to support the local boulder place of the DAV Bamberg. The idea was to build a living place were enthusiastic people could share and search new boulder problems. It should also allow to rank and discuss the problems in the boulder room. For the first seasion we are proud to have over 40 people who built a profile on the page and over 150 problems gathered so far. Visit the webside [here](http://rocknclimb.de/):\r\n```\r\nhttp://rocknclimb.de/.\r\n```\r\nWe also introduced a highscore to compete against other members while the leading member currently finished over 110 boulder.  \r\n\r\n### Implementation Overview\r\nThe system is build using a mix of PHP and Javascript. The application is supported by JQuery and JQuery Mobile in order to give it a polished view on mobile devices. Ajax calls fetch the data from the server using PHP handlers in a more or less RESTfull way. The serverside PHP is only a very thin and lightweight data-layer from and to the database (currently mysql). The returning JSON is fetched by a viewmodel used for the binding to the view. For the Binding Knockout.js is used. In the end JQuery Mobile renders the Page.\r\n\r\nFramework used for the implementation are:\r\n```\r\nKnockoutJs\r\nJQuery\r\nJQuery Mobile\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCurrently we is only me @rockgobo. I am developing in my freetime and on my own.
